I trying to change the actor and critic model and make them different (not the same)
In the 5m timeframe, things are wierd. Almost random. But most of the time, our trades are in loss.
Yesterday, actor and critic where the same. Today, I changed them.
I feel that in the combination where critic model was based on Dense and actor was CNN, results where better.
Anyway, they were both unreliable. But, again, Dense-CNN where better in my eyes.
In the meantime, this configuration was not suitable for the 1H timeframe. Daily profits were less than holding.

Testing 4H timeframe. Better than 1H and of course, 5m, but still far behind holding and considering the fact that
we have not relized the fee inside each transaction.
Now I want to change the lookback window, decrease it to 24H.

I have tested 8H and the results were not acceptable. The lookback window was 48H.
I have witnessed that although I trained the newtork with the lookback set on 48 (6*8), the result were better
when I decreased it to (5*8), but the decreasing it further (4*8) and increasing it, made the results worse.
I saw that the prediction is better when we try to predict the dateframes near the final train date. As we go
further, it become worse. 
In the meantime, decreasing the lookback from (15*8, the trained parameter) to (12*8)
made the prediction better.
Ok, it is not reliable. in that particular model, decresing the lookback in the downtrend was
destructive but, in the uptrend, it was improving the result.
I changed the model to CNN-CNN, and in this configuration, changing the lookback is not 
constructive.
